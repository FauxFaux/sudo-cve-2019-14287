     - install man/man8/sudo_root.8 (Ubuntu specific)
     - install apport hooks
   - debian/sudo-ldap.dirs, debian/sudo.dirs: add

     that if the user successfully authenticated and he is in the 'admin'
     group, then create a stamp ~/.sudo_as_admin_successful. Our default bash

    - fix for CVE-2010-1163
    - fix for CVE-2010-0426
    - debian/sudo.postinst, debian/sudo-ldap.postinst: update description to
      match behavior in sudoers file
    - don't install init script. Debian moved to /var/lib/sudo from
      /var/run/sudo, so Ubuntu's tmpfs usage won't clean those out
      automatically any more, so we now need the initscript.
